# breast-cancer-prediction

dataset provided by uci repository. 

Data set consists of various features such as Clump Thickness, Marginal Adhesion, Bland Chromatin, Normal Nucleoli etc.  which shows the presence of Benign (class -2) and malignant (class -4) tumors. Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors tend to grow slowly and do not spread. Malignant tumors can grow rapidly, invade and destroy nearby normal tissues, and spread throughout the body. 
After testing the dataset with various models the highest accuracy was obtained by decision tree classifier with predicted accuracy of 95%.
while Naive bayes and SVM : 94.1%
     KNN and Logistic regression: 94.7%
     random forest: 93.56%
